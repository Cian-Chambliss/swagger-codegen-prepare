## Swagger Code Generation Prepare

Prepare swagger definition for template engine consumption.

This is adapted from swagger-js-codegen, only keeping the logic that prepares the object for template engine. This is intended to be used in conjunction with either mustache or handlebars.

Installation

```sh
npm install swagger-js-codegen
```
